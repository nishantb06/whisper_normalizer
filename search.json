Using Whisper normalization can cause issues in Indic languages and other low resource languages when using BasicTextNormalizer. So normalization in Indic languages is also implemented in this package which was derived from indic-nlp-library.\nThis package is a python implementation of the text standardisation/normalization approach which is being used in OpenAI whisper. The code was originally being released as open-source in Whisper source code. More details about the text normalization approach used by whisper can be found on Appendix Section C pp.21 the paper Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision by OpenAI team.",

From education to entertainment, from journalism to justice, from science to art, these models could enable new forms of learning, storytelling, reporting, reasoning, discovery, and creation.\n\nThey could also create new ethical, social, and cultural challenges that require careful reflection and regulation. How we use this technology will depend on how we recognize its implications for ourselves and others.\n\nThis technology is a form of “Artificial Intelligence”. The word “intelligence” derives from inter- (“between”) and legere (“to choose, pick out, read”). To be intelligent, then, is to be able to choose between things, to pick out what matters, to read what is written.
